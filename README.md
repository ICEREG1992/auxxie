# Auxxie
Auxxie is an asymmetrical web app designed to streamline "aux cord" use at social gatherings and hangouts.

On a main screen, open the site and create a room. Then, users can join in on their phones to add songs to the queue and vote on songs posted by other users. If the queue runs out-- no problem! Hosts can configure their screen and their playlist as they please, selecting a "background" playlist of songs to default to if nobody wants to hear anything in particular.

Auxxie is still in development.
